## Coloring

This example looks at dividing a compute space (WORLD) into multiple 
computer regions.

### Compiling

Building this example requires that you have installed OpenMPI onto 
your computer AND it was compiled using the correct compiler. As
in clang, gcc, or apple clang. This will change how the linker will
find functions in libraries.
